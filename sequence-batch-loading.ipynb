    "As it turns out, RNNs tend to be really slow to train. This is mainly because they are tough to train in batches. You can only run one input at a time through the network. Its worth noting this is one of the big reasons Transformer-based architectures have performed so well compared to traditional sequence-based models. Thankfully, PyTorch has a bunch of built-in methods to help speed up training RNNs. In this notebook, we'll explore a few of those.\n",
